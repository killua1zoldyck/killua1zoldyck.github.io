        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Anirudh Krishnan, a dedicated software developer with two years of hands-on experience in the field. I
          am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Arizona State University, delving deep into the realm of technology
          and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Fidelity Investments, I've tackled significant data challenges, architecting and implementing systems designed to manage 
          and process large-scale datasets. I've navigated complex problems, leveraging a keen eye for detail and a disciplined approach 
          to programming. These attributes play a pivotal role in crafting innovative solutions. I thrive on unraveling intricate puzzles, 
          employing a combination of technical expertise and problem-solving acumen to devise efficient and effective systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I have a profound love for gardening. There's something fulfilling about nurturing and
          watching plants grow, a parallel to problem-solvingâ€”both require patience, dedication, and attention to
          detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not immersed in coding or tending to my garden, I actively seek new challenges, embracing the joy of
          problem-solving, and relishing the excitement of discovering innovative solutions.
        </p>
